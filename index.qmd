## About me

Jessica Guo is a data scientist at the [University of Arizona](https://datascience.cals.arizona.edu/) and a plant ecophysiologist at the [Desert Botanical Garden](https://dbg.org/research-conservation/dpel/). She blends her passion for data science education and expertise in desert plant water use to ask:

1)  How do plants balance twin demands for water and carbon?

2)  How do plant water use strategies impact whole ecosystem water and carbon fluxes?
