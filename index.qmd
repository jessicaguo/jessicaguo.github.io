## About me

Jessica Guo is a plant ecophysiologist and data scientist who studies plant-environment interactions under extreme climate, focusing on drylands subject to potentially lethal combinations of heat and drought. Her research has led to novel understanding of how drought-tolerant species regulate plant water status. She blends her passion for reproducible workflows, interactive visualizations, and hierarchical Bayesian models with expertise in plant water relations to address the following questions:

1)  How do plants regulate water status under variable and more extreme climate?

2)  How do plant water use strategies impact whole ecosystem water and carbon fluxes?
