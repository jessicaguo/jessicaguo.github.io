Jessica Guo is a plant ecophysiologist and data scientist who studies plant-environment interactions under extreme climate, focusing on drylands subject to potentially lethal combinations of heat and drought. She blends her passion for reproducible workflows, interactive visualizations, and hierarchical Bayesian models with expertise in plant water relations to address the following questions:

1)  How do plants regulate water status under variable and more extreme climate?

2)  How do plant water use strategies impact whole ecosystem water and carbon fluxes?
