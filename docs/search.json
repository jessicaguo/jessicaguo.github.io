    "text": "Timeseries analysis of VOCs\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) of decomposing litter can signal the presence and activity of the microbial community. I designed an algorithm and app for detrending, modeling, and classifying 304 VOC timeseries (not yet public).\n\n\nExploring a C. diffile gene expression database\nThe bacterial pathogen Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of health-care related bacterial infections in the US, and the mechanisms of disease are poorly understood and actively investigated. I built an app for researchers to query and visualize gene expression data across published studies.\n\n\nPostfire effect of rangeland restoration practices\nA naturally-occurring fire burned a rangeland restoration experiment, offering a unique opportunity to assess how well herbicide, grazing, and native grass seeding could control cheatgrass invasion after a major disturbance. I implemented a series of Bayesian ANOVAs to assess biomass, count, and cover of Bromus tectorum that accounted for overdispersion and a complex experimental design.\n\n\nPredicting trends in US organic agriculture\nUnderstanding future trends in organic acriculture sales can inform production decisions by growers; while the USDA conducts surveys at the state level, data are infrequent and sometimes missing. We developed Bayesian hierarchical regression models to estimate trends in the number of organic farms, area under organic production, and sales of organic produce, which included missing values and error estimates."

    "text": "Stomatal regulation in desert riparian trees\n\nIn dryland ecosystems, riparian trees are foundation species that provision key ecosystem services, including habitat for rare or endangered species. Thus, it is important to understand riparian tree responses to increasing atmospheric dryness and water limitation. Using sap flux time series, I modeled how the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit changes sub-seasonally in (1) a common garden drought experiment and (2) nine naturally-occurring species across an elevation gradient.\n\n\nHydraulic behavior and NSC dynamics of Larrea tridentata\n\nPlant water potential is an integrated measure of water status that underlies the critical plant functions of photosynthesis and transpiration. However, plant water potential is typically measured too infrequently (~monthly) to capture its dependence on environmental variables such as soil moisture and atmospheric dryness, which can be highly dynamic. In the evergreen desert shrub Larrea tridentata, I used sub-daily measurements of water potential (pressure chamber and stem psychrometer) coupled with frequent monitoring of non-structural carbohydrates to understand (1) the diurnal and seasonal responses of plant water status to environmental drivers and (2) the consequences for plant carbon dynamics.\n\n\nSpecies coexistence under water limitation\n\nDo co-existing plants partition water resources as suggested by species coexistence theory? In an early attempt to blend community ecology with plant ecophysiology, I addressed this question by comparing stem and soil water isotopes along an elevation gradient in Northern Arizona, ranging from the upland Sonoran Desert to the spruce-fir forests in the San Francisco Peaks. By calculating niche overlap with output from a Bayesian mixture model, we found that plants in more arid ecosystems do indeed have less overlap between species pairs than plants in more mesic ecosystems."
