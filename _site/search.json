    "text": "Jessica Guo is a plant ecophysiologist and data scientist who studies plant-environment interactions under extreme climate, focusing on drylands subject to potentially lethal combinations of heat and drought. Her research has led to novel understanding of how drought-tolerant species regulate plant water status. She blends her passion for reproducible workflows, interactive visualizations, and hierarchical Bayesian models with expertise in plant water relations to address the following questions:\n\nHow do plants regulate water status under variable and more extreme climate?\nHow do plant water use strategies impact whole ecosystem water and carbon fluxes?\n\n\n\nNorthern Arizona University Flagstaff, AZ\nPh.D. in Biological Sciences | 2019\nM.S. in Biological Sciences | 2013\nArizona State University Tempe, AZ\nCertificate in Statistics | 2015\nColumbia University New York, NY\nB.A. in Environmental Biology | 2010"

    "text": "Species coexistence under water limitation\nDo co-existing plants partition water resources as suggested by species coexistence theory? In my early attempt to blend community ecology with plant ecophysiology, I addressed this question by comparing stem and soil water isotopes along an elevation gradient in Northern Arizona, ranging from the upland Sonoran Desert to the spruce-fir forests in the San Francisco Peaks. By calculating niche overlap with output from a Bayesian mixture model, we found that plants in more arid ecosystems do indeed have less overlap between species pairs than plants in more mesic ecosystems."
